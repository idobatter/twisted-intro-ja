    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">Whew! Thank you for sticking with me. When I started this series I didn’t realize it was going to be this long, or take this much time to make. But I have enjoyed creating it and hope you have enjoyed reading it.</p>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">Now that I have finished, I will look into the possibility of generating a PDF format. No promises, though.</p>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">I would like to conclude with a few suggestions on how to continue your Twisted education.</p>
    <h3 class="lwe-editable-pre">Further Reading</h3>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">First, I would recommend reading the Twisted <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Documentation" class="lwe-editable-pre">online documentation</a>. Although it is much-maligned, I think it’s better than it is often given credit for.</p>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">If you want to use Twisted for web programming, then Jean-Paul Calderone has a well-regarded series called “<a href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/50562.html" class="lwe-editable-pre">Twisted Web in 60 Seconds</a>“. I suspect it will take a little longer than that to read, though.</p>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100329?ie=UTF8&tag=jpcalsjou-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596100329" class="lwe-editable-pre">Twisted Book</a>, which I can’t say much about as I haven’t read it.</p>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">But more important than any of those, I think, is to read the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk" class="lwe-editable-pre">Twisted source code</a>. Since that code is written by people who know Twisted very well, it is an excellent source of examples for how do to things the “Twisted Way”.</p>
    <h3 class="lwe-editable-pre">Suggested Exercises</h3>
    <ol class="">
    <li class="lwe-editable-pre">Port a synchronous program you wrote to Twisted.</li>
    <li class="lwe-editable-pre">Write a new Twisted program from scratch.</li>
    <li class="lwe-editable-pre">Pick a bug from the Twisted <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report" class="lwe-editable-pre">bug database</a> and fix it. Submit a patch to the Twisted developers. Don’t forget to read about the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ContributingToTwistedLabs" class="lwe-editable-pre">process</a> for making your contribution.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="lwe-editable-pre">The End, Really</h3>
    <p class="lwe-editable-pre">Happy Hacking!<br>
